#KinKong
An easy, fun and cool trivia game where you can earn KIN !

## What's it all about?
Each day we will update a trivia question.
When the timer countdown will end you will see our community manager ask you a simple question related to crypto.<br/>
You will have 10 seconds to answer the question, once you select an answer you won't be able to change it so keep it in mind.<br/>
After the 10 seconds you'll see if your answer was correct or wrong.
The winners will get to their account the daily relative prize: which will be the total daily prize divided by the winners count.


## How to play
Once we will upload the app to GooglePlay.
 * Open the app and this will create a Kin wallet automatically.
 * Wait for the timer countdown to end.
 * Listen to the question, and choose your answer.
 * After 10 seconds you'll see if you were correct and KIN will be send to your account.
